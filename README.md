# Theoretical and methodological challenges in hierarchical Bayesian inference for model-form uncertainty
This repository contains the source code required to reproduce the results in [1]. 

Jupyter notebooks describe their purpose and utilize the source code in Python script files.

Eigenvalues derived from DNS simulations as detailed in [2] required to reproduce results for the contaminant transport exemplar problem are provided in the `all_eigenvalue_endpoints.h5`.
